# Welcome to the Tapestry Project ðŸŽ¨

## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹  
I'm Josh, and this is **our GitHub tapestry.**

### **What's the Tapestry?**
At first glance, it's just a little white speck. But this humble canvas has the potential to grow into something much moreâ€”a vibrant, collaborative digital artwork.

Every time someone submits a new color, the tapestry evolves. Each contribution adds a pixel of your chosen color, chosen at random, to our shared masterpiece. The tapestry starts small (just 4x4 pixels), but as more people contribute, it will grow dynamically to accommodate all the new colors.

### **How Can You Contribute?**
Adding to the tapestry is easy:

1. **Submit a color**  
   Create a GitHub issue with a title in the format:  
   `Color: #RRGGBB`  
   Replace `#RRGGBB` with a valid hexadecimal color code (e.g., `#FF5733` for a vibrant orange).

2. **Watch the magic happen**  
   Once your issue is processed, your color will be added to the tapestry. If the tapestry needs more room, it will automatically expand!

### **Our Current Tapestry**
â†“ It may be small now, but itâ€™s growing with every new contribution.
