### **The Tapestry**

Every time someone submits a new color, the tapestry evolves. Each contribution adds a pixel of your chosen color to our shared masterpiece.

### **How Can You Contribute?**
Adding to the tapestry is easy:

   Just create a GitHub issue with a title in the format: `Color: #RRGGBB`
