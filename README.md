## About
Hi, I’m Josh, a year 10 student in Newcastle, Australia.

I have a strong interest in live entertainment (audio
engineering, lighting design, production management) as well as software engineering,
with a focus on iOS app development (earlier this year, I launched my first app, [onCue](https://apps.apple.com/app/oncue/id6745310412),
and I’m currently working on a second).

Outside of tech and theatre, I’m passionate about sailing and the performing arts.
