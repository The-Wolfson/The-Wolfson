## About
Hi, I’m Josh, a year 10 student in Newcastle, Australia.

I have a strong interest in live entertainment (audio
engineering, lighting design, production management) as well as software engineering,
with a focus on iOS app development (I have a couple apps on the [app store](https://apps.apple.com/developer/louise-kiernan/id1811714901), and you can be sure I'm working on more!).

Outside of tech and theatre, I’m passionate about sailing and the performing arts.
